My recent Power BI project was a challenging but rewarding endeavor that required a lot of hard work and attention to detail. 
The project involved working with real-world data, as well as several Excel spreadsheets from different years, which presented challenges in terms of missing or inconsistent data. To ensure that we had a proper dataset, I carried out extensive data cleaning and transformation, using various tools and techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency.

As a best practice, I created mock layouts of the data visualizations and all types of data models before building the final dashboard to ensure a great user experience and effective communication of the data insights. This allowed us to fine-tune the design and ensure that the visualizations were clear, engaging, and provided the necessary insights. The mock layouts also helped me to create correct relations between the tables in the dataset, avoiding any potential design flaws or misinterpretation of the data. #dataanalysis #dataanalytics #work #powerbidesktop #visualization

After that created relationships between the various tables using foreign keys and primary keys, and checked for any ambiguity in the data. Once I had a clean and reliable dataset, I built some great visualizations and an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This allowed us to explore the data in new and exciting ways, uncovering patterns and insights that would have been difficult to see otherwise. Throughout the project,  also focused on data transformation and normalization, ensuring that the data was in a format that could be easily analyzed and used to inform decision-making. Overall, the project was a great success, and I am proud of the work we accomplished. It was a great example of the power of data analysis and visualization, and how it can help organizations make better, more informed decisions. #visualthinking #datainsights #charts
